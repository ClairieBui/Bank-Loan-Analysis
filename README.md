# Bank-Loan-Analysis (MSSQL + TABLEAU PROJECT)
## üìå **Project Overview**
A comprehensive bank loan analysis report was created to monitor and evaluate lending activities. The goal was to offer insights into essential loan metrics and their trends over time, supporting data-driven decision-making, assessing portfolio health, and identifying patterns to refine lending strategies.

## ‚ùì **Problem Statement**
The bank is struggling to understand its loans performance. The key areas of concern include:
- **Total Loan Application** - Tracking MTD and MoM changes to evaluate demand and outreach effectiveness.
- **Total Funded Amount** - Monitoring loan disbursements to optimize funding and liquidity.
- **Total Amount Received** - Analyzing repayments to assess collection efficiency and defaults.
- **Average Interest Rate** - Tracking interest rate trends to ensure competitiveness and profitability.
- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)** -  Evaluating borrower risk and repayment capacity.
- **Good Loan Application** - Tracking number of loan applications falling under the 'Good Loan' category, which consists of loans with a loan status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'
- **Good Loan Funded Amount** - Determining the total amount of funds disbursed as 'Good Loans.'
- **Good Loan Amount Received** - Tracking total amount received from borrowers for 'Good Loans'.
- **Bad Loan Application** - Tracking number of loan applications falling under the 'Bad Loan' category, which consists of loans with a loan status of 'Charged off'
- **Bad Loan Funded Amount** - Determining the total amount of funds disbursed as 'Bad Loans.'
- **Bad Loan Amount Received** - Tracking the total amount received from borrowers for 'Bad Loans'.

 ## üìà **Analysis & Visualizations**
 
This project leverages MSSQL to conduct an in-depth analysis of bank loan data, focusing on key lending metrics and trends. The analysis includes:
- Loan Application Trends: Evaluating total loan applications on a Month-over-Month (MoM) and Month-to-Date (MTD) basis.
- Loan Quality Assessment: Gaining insights into the proportion of good loans vs. bad loans to assess portfolio performance.
- Interest Rate Analysis: Understanding the average interest rates applied across different loan categories.
- Loan Purpose Insights: Identifying and analyzing the common purposes for loan applications to detect trends in borrowing behavior.

The data is extracted from SQL and visualized in Tableau to create the dashboard.

Both two dashboards provide a comprehensive overview of total loan application, total funded amount, total amount received, average interest rate, average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) from month to month (MOM) and month to date (MTD).

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in the Report:

**1. Total Loan Applications:**
- **Total applications**: 38.6K
- **MTD**: 4.3k applications
- **MoM Growth**: +6.91%

**2.Total Funded Amount:**

- **Total funding**: $435.8 million 
- **MTD**: $54.0 million
- **MoM Changes:** +13.0%
  
**3.Total Received Amount:**
- **Total recived**: $473.1 million 
- **MTD**: $58.1 million
- **MoM Changes**: +15.8%
  
**4.Average Interest Rate:**
- **Overall**: 12.0%
- **MTD**: 12.4%
- **MoM**: +3.5%
  
**5.Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):**
- **DTI**: 13.3%
- **MTD**: 13.7%
- **MoM**: +2.7%

**Overview dashboard**

- 86.2% of loans are classified as good, with a funded amount of $370.2M and good loan amount received is $435.6, showing that the bank get profit from good loan applications.
- 13.8% of loans are bad, with a total funded amount of $65.5M far exceeding the bad loan amount received ($37.3M), indicating a significant repayment gap and potential risk of defaults.
- Total loan applications, funded amounts, and received amounts have steadily increased from January to December.
- California (CA) leads in total loan applications, funded amounts, and received amounts, making it a key focus area for lending.

**Analysis dashboard**

- Total Applications by Term: Short-term loans (36 months) dominate with 28.2K applications, while long-term loans (60 months) account for 10.3K applications, suggesting borrower preference for shorter commitments.
- Total Applications by Employee Length: Borrowers with 10+ years of work experience received the highest funded amounts, implying greater trust in financially stable individuals.
- Total Applications by Purpose: Debt consolidation is the leading loan purpose, reflecting customers‚Äô financial restructuring needs.

## üìå **Conclusion & Recommendations**

The data highlights strong growth in loan applications, funding, and received amounts, indicating increased customer engagement. The dominance of short-term loans and debt consolidation requests suggests a demand for manageable repayment structures. Moreover, California stands out as a major lending hub, offering strategic opportunities for targeted financial services. Despite positive trends, the presence of bad loans (13.8%) remains a concern, signaling potential credit risk that needs monitoring.

**Recommendations**

- Enhance Credit Risk Assessment: Strengthen borrower screening criteria to reduce bad loans and improve loan recovery rates.
- Leverage Growth in California: Allocate more resources to expand lending in high-demand areas like California.
- Promote Long-Term Loan Offerings: Encourage borrowers to opt for 60-month loans by offering incentives, improving customer retention and revenue stability.
- Seasonal Marketing Strategy: Capitalize on December‚Äôs peak application period with tailored promotions and streamlined application processes.
- Improve Debt Consolidation Offerings: Develop customized loan products for debt consolidation to better serve the largest customer segment.
  
By implementing these strategies, the bank can sustain loan growth, mitigate risks, and enhance overall profitability.
